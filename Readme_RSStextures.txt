Real Solar System Texture pack
NathanKell
This is a texture pack for Real Solar System, which will convert the Kerbol System into the Solar System, rescaling, moving, and changing KSP's planets, moons, etc. to match our own.

Supreme thanks to dimonnomid and SpacedInvader for incredible art for RSS. RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions.

License: CC-BY-NC-SA
Includes artwork by dimonnomid and SpacedInvader as well as some by myself.
Some planetary imagery is derived from work by Steve Albers and NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and some from the Celestia Motherlode (itself in the main sourced from JPL). Used by permission of the licenses for non-commercial release.


INSTALLATION:
Extract to KSP/GameData.
Obviously you need Real Solar System itself for this to work.
